Data and queries
================

The Semantic Web Dogfood dataset [1] is available in N-Triples (data.nt) and N-Quads (data.nq); a set of automatically generated queries from that dataset is in queries-random.txt.

JMeter
======

There is a JMeter configuration file queries.random.jmx which JMeter uses to iterates over the queries-random.txt file and perform lookups.

Proxy Setup
===========

To test CumulusRDF locally but with correct Linked Data URIs, put cumulus.war into the root of your Tomcat (mv cumulus.war ROOT.war; deploy ROOT.war) and point JMeter to use localhost tomcat-port as proxy.

Start JMeter with the "-H proxyhost -P proxyport" parameters.
